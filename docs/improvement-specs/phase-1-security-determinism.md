# Phase 1 — Security + Determinism (Month 1)

> Status: complete; released as `v0.2.0`. Retained as decision history.

Closes the structural security gaps the review flagged as the existential risks
for a *security* tool, plus the one architectural leak that undermines the
reproducible-gate promise. Every spec here assumes SPEC-03 (CI gate) is live.

## SPEC-06 — Trusted CI pipeline delivery (fix the MR-controlled definition)

- **Severity:** Critical (C1) · **Effort:** L · **ROI rank:** 2
- **Depends on:** none (but coordinate docs with SPEC-02)

### Why
Adoption is `include: - local: 'ai-review/ci/review.gitlab-ci.yml'`. On
`merge_request_event` pipelines GitLab reads the root `.gitlab-ci.yml` **and its
local includes from the MR source branch**, so a malicious MR author controls the
*job definitions* — not just the reviewed code. They can add a job that
exfiltrates `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`GITLAB_WRITE_TOKEN`/`GITLAB_READ_TOKEN`, or
simply write a passing `gate_result.json`. The baked-image adapter boundary
protects the wrong layer. This defeats every downstream control.

### Scope
- **In:** a new integration model and its docs; a reference "trusted parent
  pipeline"; hard requirements on CI/CD variable protection; changes to the
  integration guide in `README.md`; and a validator that detects unsafe
  composition.
- **Out:** GitLab-server configuration the project can't ship (document it).

### Implementation
Deliver the secret-bearing (`review`, `critique`, `prepare`) and gate/post jobs
from a location the MR branch **cannot edit**. Pick and document one of:

1. **`include: project` + full commit SHA.** Host the CI template in a
   **separate, protected** repository and have consumers
   `include: { project: 'org/code-tribunal-ci', ref: '<40-character-sha>',
   file: '/ai-review/ci/review.gitlab-ci.yml' }`. Because `include: project`
   resolves against the immutable named commit, not the MR branch, an MR author
   cannot alter the job definitions. Provide a CODEOWNERS checklist.
2. **Parent/child pipeline with a trusted child.** The consumer's root pipeline
   is minimal and triggers a child pipeline whose config comes from the pinned
   trusted ref; secrets live only in the child.
3. **Protected trigger token on a protected ref** for the secret jobs.

In all variants:
- **Mandate Protected CI/CD variables.** Update the README variable table
  (currently only "Masked") to require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GITLAB_READ_TOKEN`,
  `GITLAB_WRITE_TOKEN` be **Protected**, and explain that Protected variables are
  withheld from unprotected MR-branch pipelines — which is the entire point.
- **Kill the `local:` instructions.** Replace the `include: local:` snippet in
  `README.md` with the trusted-ref pattern and a bold warning that `local:` is
  insecure for secret-bearing jobs.
- `scripts/verify_pipeline_trust.py` validates the selected direct or child
  topology against operator-supplied trusted project and full-SHA inputs. Child
  mode permits exactly the wrapper and DAG project includes and rejects every
  extra include kind or entry. It also requires the bridge to disable inherited
  YAML and forwarded pipeline variables so MR-controlled values cannot override
  the trusted child runtime.

### Acceptance criteria
- Documented, reproducible integration where a hostile MR that edits the pipeline
  YAML **cannot** obtain Protected variables or forge a passing gate. Validate on
  a scratch GitLab project and record the evidence requested in
  [SPEC-06 Trusted CI Delivery Runbook](spec-06-trusted-ci-runbook.md).
- README no longer instructs `include: local:` for secret-bearing stages.

### Tests
- Manual/scripted validation on a scratch GitLab project (documented runbook in
  the spec's PR), plus negative trust-auditor tests for mismatched refs/projects,
  movable refs, duplicate or extra entries, local/remote/component inputs, and
  root/bridge variable injection.

### Risk / rollback
- High blast radius on *integration UX* (consumers must restructure). Mitigate
  with a migration guide and keeping the old template working for
  non-secret/advisory-only mode. This is the single most important change; do it
  carefully and with the owner's sign-off on the chosen variant.

## SPEC-07 — State-note author verification / HMAC

- **Severity:** High (H1) · **Effort:** S · **ROI rank:** 3
- **Depends on:** none

### Why
`state_note_candidates` selects notes purely by the `ai-review-state:v1` marker;
`decode_state_note_body` verifies a **keyless, self-computed** SHA-256 (integrity,
not authenticity). There is **no author check**. Anyone who can comment on the MR
can forge a state note marking findings `resolved`/`wontfix` (→ never posted,
existing threads auto-resolved with the write token) and poison
`prior_decisions.json` fed into reviewer prompts. Loaded in both trusted
`prepare` (`input_bundle.py`) and `post` (`post.py`). The spec itself
(`specs/…:536`) says only bot-authored notes should count; human `/ai-review`
commands already enforce `access_level ≥ 30` — the far more powerful state note
does not.

### Scope
- **In:** `ai-review/src/ai_review/memory.py`
  (`state_note_candidates`, `newest_valid_state_from_notes`),
  `ai-review/src/ai_review/post.py` (`load_persisted_state`,
  `state_from_existing_discussions` recovery path),
  `ai-review/src/ai_review/input_bundle.py` (`prepare_gitlab_bundle` state load),
  `ai-review/src/ai_review/gitlab_client.py` (needs a "current user" / note
  author accessor — `current_user()` already exists).
- **Out:** redesigning the state schema.

### Implementation
Primary defense — **author allow-listing:**
1. Fetch the bot identity once (`client.current_user()` → user id/username).
2. Thread the note `author` through to `state_note_candidates` /
   `newest_valid_state_from_notes` and **discard any candidate whose author id is
   not the bot**. Notes in GitLab carry `author.id`; the note list already
   includes it.
3. Apply the same author filter to the discussion-marker recovery path
   (`recover_from_discussion_markers`) so recovery can't be seeded by a hostile
   comment either.

Defense in depth — **HMAC the payload (optional but recommended):**
4. Replace the bare `sha256(payload)` with `HMAC-SHA256(payload, secret)` where
   the secret is a CI/CD variable available only to the trusted jobs (never the
   reviewer container). Keep backward-compatible read of legacy notes behind a
   config flag during migration, then require HMAC.

### Acceptance criteria
- A forged `ai-review-state:v1` note authored by a non-bot user is **ignored**
  by both `prepare` and `post`; a warning is recorded.
- Legitimate bot-authored state round-trips unchanged.
- (If HMAC) a note with a valid SHA but invalid HMAC is rejected.

### Tests
- New `tests/security/test_state_note_authenticity.py`: forged-author note is
  dropped; bot-authored note is accepted; (HMAC) tampered-payload rejected.
- Extend `test_find_matching_record` / `test_state_hash` for the author-threaded
  API.

### Risk / rollback
- Medium: existing MRs may hold legacy notes without an author filter passing.
  Mitigate with a migration window that reads legacy notes but re-writes them
  bot-authored/HMAC'd, then flips to strict.

## SPEC-08 — Cap severity downgrade at one level; default critique flags false

- **Severity:** High (H6) · **Effort:** S · **ROI rank:** 7
- **Depends on:** none

### Why
CONSENSUS.md §5 says downgrade is "capped at one level," but
`consensus.py:418-425` applies `_severity_after_one_level_downgrade` **once per
disputing critic**, so two third-party disputers take `blocker→major→minor`.
Because the gate blocks only on `blocker`, two biased/prompt-injected peers can
un-block a genuine blocker. Shipped `review.yaml` enables
`allow_severity_downgrade`/`allow_advisory_escalation` even though schema defaults
are `false`.

### Scope
- **In:** `ai-review/src/ai_review/consensus.py` (`_apply_critiques` downgrade
  loop), `ai-review/config/review.yaml` (the two critique flags).
- **Out:** the escalation logic's other branches (leave `agree`/`noise` as-is
  except where the flag default changes them).

### Implementation
1. Change the downgrade loop so the **group** drops at most **one** severity rank
   total, regardless of how many critics dispute — apply the single-level cap to
   the *group outcome*, not per critique. Preserve determinism (still iterate
   sorted critiques; compute the final severity as
   `max(current_rank - 1, min_adjusted_rank_requested)` clamped to one step).
2. Add an invariant: critique adjustments may **never** move a finding across the
   `blocker → non-blocker` boundary (a genuine quorum blocker cannot be
   downgraded out of blocking by critique). Encode as an explicit guard.
3. Flip the shipped `review.yaml` defaults for `allow_severity_downgrade` and
   `allow_advisory_escalation` to `false` (match the schema/`validate_config`
   defaults). Document the security rationale inline.
4. Update `CONSENSUS.md` §5 to match the enforced behavior.

### Acceptance criteria
- With 2–3 third-party disputers on a `blocker`, `final_severity` never drops
  more than one rank and `summary.block_merge` stays `true`.
- Shipped config runs with downgrade/escalation off by default.

### Tests
- Extend `test_phase5_consensus.py`: multi-disputer downgrade is capped at one
  level; blocker-boundary guard holds; a golden assertion that
  `block_merge` survives disputes.

### Risk / rollback
- Low. Behavior becomes stricter (safer). If a deployment wants the old
  permissive behavior, it can re-enable the flags explicitly and accept the
  documented risk — but the boundary guard stays.

## SPEC-09 — Extract `render.py`; decouple consensus from post

- **Severity:** High (H5) · **Effort:** S · **ROI rank:** 8
- **Depends on:** SPEC-03 · **Blocks:** SPEC-13, SPEC-14

### Why
The "pure" reducer imports the GitLab-facing presentation module
(`consensus.py` imports `render_body` from `post.py`) solely to compute
`body_hash` from Markdown formatting. A cosmetic comment-template change silently
changes every `body_hash` in the *decision* artifact; it only imports because
`gitlab_client` lazy-imports `requests`. This violates the CONSENSUS.md "no I/O
in the reducer" contract and couples reproducibility to unpinned UI code.

### Scope
- **In:** new `ai-review/src/ai_review/render.py`; `consensus.py` and `post.py`
  imports.
- **Out:** changing the rendered Markdown output (byte-for-byte identical result
  required).

### Implementation
1. Move `render_body`, `compute_body_hash`, `source_hash`, `sanitize_model_text`,
   `validate_suggestion` (the presentation+hash helpers) from `post.py` into a
   new `render.py` with **no** dependency on `gitlab_client`.
2. `consensus.py` imports `render_body`/`compute_body_hash` from `render.py`;
   `post.py` re-imports from `render.py` (or keeps thin wrappers for compat).
3. Add a **version constant** `RENDER_BODY_VERSION` in `render.py` and fold it
   into the `body_hash` input, so an intentional template change is an explicit,
   reviewable version bump rather than a silent artifact change.
4. Confirm `consensus` no longer transitively imports `requests`.

### Acceptance criteria
- `import ai_review.consensus` works in an environment **without** `requests`
  installed.
- A golden `consensus.json` (see SPEC-12) is byte-identical before/after the
  refactor for the same inputs.
- No change to the Markdown actually posted (post-path snapshot unchanged).

### Tests
- A test that imports `consensus` with `requests` uninstalled/blocked (monkeypatch
  `sys.modules`).
- Golden-hash test: same finding group → same `body_hash` pre/post refactor.

### Risk / rollback
- Low, mechanical. The version constant prevents future silent drift.

## SPEC-10 — Fork-secret gate + stale-record retention + config-validation completeness

- **Severity:** Medium (M9 + M5 + M13) · **Effort:** S · **ROI rank:** 13, 18
- **Depends on:** SPEC-03

### Why
Three cheap correctness/security gaps bundled (all small, all independent of the
big refactors):
- **M9:** `allow_external_fork_secrets` is read nowhere; no
  `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID != CI_PROJECT_ID` gate. The documented
  fork-safety control doesn't exist.
- **M5:** `compact_state` prunes only `resolved`/`superseded`; `stale`/
  `stale_unverified` records are kept forever → long-lived MR hits `max_records`
  (200) → `state_overflow` → `gate.py` treats it as `block_merge=True`. A busy MR
  can self-block.
- **M13:** `decision_for_group` dereferences `config["severity_policy"][...]`
  without `.get`, but `validate_config` doesn't validate `severity_policy` → raw
  `KeyError` on a config that "passed."

### Scope
- **In:** `input_bundle.py`/`ci/review.gitlab-ci.yml` (fork gate),
  `memory.py:compact_state` (retention), `config.py:validate_config`.
- **Out:** the broader dead-config cleanup (SPEC-17).

### Implementation
1. **Fork gate:** in `prepare` (and/or the CI rules), when
   `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID != CI_PROJECT_ID` and
   `security.allow_external_fork_secrets` is false, refuse to run the
   secret-bearing path (fail closed with a clear message). Actually consult the
   config key.
2. **Retention:** in `compact_state`, add a retention rule for `stale` /
   `stale_unverified` (e.g. keep last N by run, matching
   `keep_resolved_runs`/`keep_superseded_runs`) so they can't grow unbounded.
   Add config keys under `state.retention` with sane defaults.
3. **Validation:** extend `validate_config` to validate the `severity_policy`
   subtree that consensus dereferences (`single_reviewer_blocker.categories`,
   `quorum_blocker.block_merge`), raising a clean `ConfigError`.

### Acceptance criteria
- A fork MR with `allow_external_fork_secrets: false` does not run secret jobs.
- A synthetic long-lived MR with many `stale` records stays under `max_records`
  after compaction.
- A config missing `severity_policy` raises `ConfigError`, not `KeyError`.

### Tests
- `test_config_env_overrides.py`/new: missing `severity_policy` → `ConfigError`.
- `memory` test: `compact_state` bounds stale records.
- Fork-gate unit test around the prepare decision.

### Risk / rollback
- Low. Retention defaults should be generous enough not to drop live context;
  make them configurable.
